nav (similar to div just a container)

by default all elements have marigin and padding so it is important to set the padding and margin to zero 

navigation bar prefered way is use ul and li

li:hover{
    color: white;
}

-- when the mouse is over the text the color will be changed
cursor: pointer; // finger symbol when hover
